The project is built with React and Vite.
Typescript has been used throughout.
Date-fns has been used to format the `Created At` date/time of the task.
Transitions were created using only TailwindCss.

Design Decisions and Considerations:

A simple, clean design was used with a clear UX and easy-to-use functionality. Icons were used for the dark mode toggle and delete task to add a bit of fun.
Accessability has been covered with aria labels where required.
Mobile screen has been accommodated.
